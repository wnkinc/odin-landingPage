LIVE PREVIEW - http://wnkinc.github.io/odin-landingPage


Practice project to incorporate knowledge learned so far about basic html, css, git, and cli. 
Post Project: Was relatively easy, completed in about 3 hours. CSS sure can get messy! Tried to stay organized by indenting elements that were nested in others. I did not try and save space by combining elements with common attributes. HTML seems clean and well done, there could be an extra div in their, but i'm moving on.
